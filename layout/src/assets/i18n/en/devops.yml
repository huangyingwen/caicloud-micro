tips:
  cargoWorkspaceTip:
    The image built in this workspace can only be pushed to the specified image
    repository project
  cargoWorkspaceDefaultTip: Create a project in image repository with the same name as this workspace.
  cargoWorkspaceCustomTip: Select items in the image repository
  descriptionPlaceholder: Optional, length of description should not be more than 100
  serverTip: Enter the address
  OAuthTip: If ${name} has two-factor authentication, please use Token authentication method
  namePlaceholder: Can be included with lowercase letters or numbers - Length should not be more than 30
  aliasTip: For the pipeline interface display
  aliasPlaceholder: Support Chinese name
  usernameTip: Fill in the correct user name and password to ensure that you can authorize
  pipelineBrief:
    Continuous integration pipeline can pull the code from the source management tools, followed by unit testing, code scanning and image building,
    integration testing, image publishing, deployment and other workflows to
    provide the best solution for DevOps, greatly reducing the threshold of
    DevOps practice.
  emptyWorkspace: Please create a workspace first
  dockerfileTip: By default, Dockerfile in the codebase is used
  dockerfilePlaceholder: Dockerfile file path
  imageNamePlaceholder: Please enter repo name
  commandPlaceholder: Multiple commands split by carriage return
  outputPlaceholder: The file need to copy to the build mirror from the code build environment, not the files or folders in the current directory
